## Introduction

This is the implementation of the above paper. We develop 3 shape features to quantify cell morphology. We also conduct multiple experiments and evaluations on real living biological worm's embryos, *C. elegans*. 

## Function Usages Introduction
### test1.py/calculate_SPHARM_embryo_for_cells: calculate the spherical harmonics (transform) coefficient, *eigenharmonic*, for 1 embryo (3D+T) data.
### test1.py/SPHARM_eigenharmonic: calculate every cell's *Eigenharmonic Weight Vector*

### test1.py/Map2D_grid_csv: calculate the spherical grid coefficient, *eigengrid*, for 1 embryo (3D+T) data.
### test1.py/Map_2D_eigengrid: calculate every cell's *Eigengrid Weight Vector*

### transformation/test1.py/do_sampling_with_interval: do sampling on the cell objects one by one for spherical grid.


## Documents
The code is built in hierarchical structure, one sub-dict is a package, the higher packages can use functions in lower packages.

### Lineage Tree Draw
* use ./lineage_stat/draw_test.py -> 
  * cell fate label tree -> draw_cell_fate_lineage_tree_01paper()

## Abstract
Embryogenesis, inherently three-dimensional, poses significant challenges in quantification when approached through 3D fluorescence imaging. Traditional descriptors such as volume, surface, and mean curvature often fall short, providing only a global view and lacking in local detail and reconstruction capability. Addressing this, we introduce an effective integrated method, 3D Cell Shape Quantification (3DCSQ), for transforming digitized 3D cell shapes into analytical feature vectors. This method uniquely combines spherical grids, spherical harmonics, and principal component analysis for a comprehensive approach to cell shape quantification, analysis, and visualization. We demonstrate 3DCSQ's effectiveness in recognizing cellular morphological phenotypes and clustering cells, utilizing feature vectors that are rigorously tested. Applied to Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, from 4- to 350-cell stages, 3DCSQ reliably identifies and quantifies biologically reproducible cellular patterns, including distinct skin cell deformations. By integrating cellular surface extraction, feature vector development, and cell shape clustering, 3DCSQ offers a robust platform for exploring cell shape's relationship with cell fate, enhancing our understanding of embryogenesis. This method not only systematizes cell shape description and evaluation but also monitors cell differentiation through shape changes, presenting a significant advancement in biological imaging and analysis.

Keywords: spherical harmonics (SPHARM), cell shape quantification, morphological reproducibility, lineage analysis, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)

## Scientific Concepts

### Curvature Of cell

#### Gaussian curvature using libigl

https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/tut-chapter1/


**Principal curvatures**ï¼š the biggest and smallest radius of the points.

## Code Implementation

### Lineage tree draw
* generate the tree files with command first go to lineage_stat folder
```bash
    $ python generate_life_span.py  
```
1. this file would use function **construct_basic_tree** which would build a tree base on CD file with x position by cells' generation which time list is empty.
2. code in file **generate_life_span.py** would add cells' frames to the trees base on CD files.
3.  the CShaper embryo info, so i use embryo 06 to build basic tree in funcion **draw_PCA_combined**. 

* draw the average tree
    1. first, function **draw_PCA_combined** would construct a average lineage tree for all embryos.
    2. second, the function **get_combined_lineage_tree** would go through this lineage tree and get the frame cells' values depend on time/frame resolutions.
    3. third, at the drawing step, we would calculate all average value first and give cells values at different tp.
    4. fourth, we go through the tree again and do interpolation for the lost cells. 

* the legend frontzise is set at function **draw_life_span_tree**.
